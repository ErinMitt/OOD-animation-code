We did not need to make any changes for our customers.
We hope this means that our code was well-designed and adaptable,
   and not that we were so mean to our customers that we scared them off
   from requesting necessary changes.

At one point we received a request to write an interface for the Motion class,
   but several hours later received a reply that it was no longer necessary.

We did end up fixing a graphical bug and sending the revised code to the customers,
   but the change was not design-related (it just made the display prettier).
